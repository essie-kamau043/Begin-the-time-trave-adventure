As I learned in a course on future thinking, “The future may not be knowable, but it certainly is thinkable.” To ensure a prosperous future, it is no long sufficient to react and adapt to change, but, rather, now we must anticipate it and plan for it. The accelerating pace of change has outstripped our ability to adapt quickly enough and, much like the dinosaurs, if we are unable to adapt quickly enough to change, we too, will become extinct.
