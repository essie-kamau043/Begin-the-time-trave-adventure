As I learned in a course on future thinking, “The future may not be knowable, but it certainly is thinkable.” To ensure a prosperous future, it is no long sufficient to react and adapt to change, but, rather, now we must anticipate it and plan for it. The accelerating pace of change has outstripped our ability to adapt quickly enough and, much like the dinosaurs, if we are unable to adapt quickly enough to change, we too, will become extinct.
One morning, Peter was out walking in a forest near his home. Feeling tired, he decided to rest on a patch of grass and eventually dozed off. After only a few minutes of deep sleep, he heard someone calling his name. “Peter! Peter!” came the shrill voice from above. As he slowly opened his eyes, he was startled to see a striking woman standing above him. She must have been over a hundred years old and her snow-white hair dangled well below her shoulders like a matted blanket of wool.
